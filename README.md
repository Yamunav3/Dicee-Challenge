# Dicee-Challenge
The Dicee Challenge Game is a simple, interactive web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a dice roll between two players, and the player with the highest roll wins the game. The game uses random number generation to simulate the dice rolls and DOM manipulation to display results dynamically.
